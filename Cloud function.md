## Getting started with IBM Cloud Functions

With IBM Cloud™ Functions you can use your favorite programming language to write lightweight code that runs app logic in a scalable way. You can run code on-demand with HTTP-based API requests from applications or run code in response to IBM Cloud services and third-party events. The Function-as-a-Service (Faas) programming platform is based on the open source project Apache OpenWhisk.

##  Working with actions
With IBM Cloud™ Functions, you can create stateless code snippets, called actions, that are set to perform one specific task. To learn more about actions and other Functions terms, see terminology.

Click an option to get started.
## Creating an action in the GUI
To get started with Cloud Functions, try creating the Hello World quickstart template.

1. Create an [Ibm cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/registration) account or log in to an existing account.

2. Navigate to the [cloud function dashboard](https://cloud.ibm.com/functions).

2. Click **Start Creating** > **Quickstart Templates** and select the **Hello World** template.

3. Create a package for your actions by inputting a unique name in the **Package Name** field.

4. Select a runtime from the drop-down menu in the **Action helloworld** section. You can preview the code for the sample action in each available runtime before you deploy the template.

5. Click **Deploy**. You created an action. Great job!
6. Run the action by clicking **Invoke**. Invoking an action manually runs the app logic that the action defines. In the **Activations** panel, you can see the "Hello stranger!" greeting produced by the action.

You can get the output as below:
